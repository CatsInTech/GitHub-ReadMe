## Introduction

Introducing our latest product, the hassle-free and open-source GitHub Profile ReadMe customisation tool! With no login or registration required, you can quickly mix and match different components to create an impressive and informative GitHub Profile ReadMe page. Our drag and drop functionality makes the customisation a breeze, and with the tool being Open Source, you can expect new ideas and features to be added regularly. Try it out today and take your GitHub profile to the next level! 💪🏻

This project is exclusive to GirlScript Summer of Code and it’s assumed that you’re participating in it, so kindly don’t specify this if you’re raising an issue or a pull request. I’ll be definitely giving sarcastic responses, if you fail to follow this and don’t blame me! 😅

### Motivation

As a software engineer, I understand the importance of having a well-organised and informative GitHub profile ReadMe page. It not only helps users understand the developer’s skills and experience but also showcases their creativity and attention to detail. However, with so many people creating different styles of ReadMe pages, it can be challenging to keep track of all the available components and customisation options. 🤯

That’s why I believe that creating a comprehensive guide to GitHub profile ReadMe customisation is a valuable project. By compiling all the available components and customisation options in one place, we can provide developers with a go-to resource for creating impressive and informative profile ReadMe pages. This project will not only help developers save time by not having to search for different options but also ensure that they don’t miss out on any essential components. 🥹

As a software engineer, I am committed to creating user-focused software that meets the needs of the end-user. By providing a comprehensive guide to GitHub profile ReadMe customisation, we can help developers create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces that enhance the user experience. Additionally, I understand the importance of time management and quality assurance in software development. By thoroughly testing and ensuring that the guide is free of bugs and errors, we can deliver a high-quality resource that developers can rely on. 👌🏻

In summary, this project is motivated by the need to provide developers with a comprehensive guide to GitHub profile ReadMe customisation. By doing so, we can help developers save time, not miss out on any essential components, and create user-focused and high-quality profile ReadMe pages that showcase their skills and experience. 💪🏻

## Development

### System Requirements

Here’s a recommended guide, but if you want to know what exactly I use, feel free to check out [My Personal Development Environment](https://blog.praveen.science/my-personal-development-environment/) and clone it for yourself. 💻

* **Operating System:** Windows / Mac / Linux
* **Version Control:** Git
* **Browser:** Google Chrome + React Developer Tools
* **Run Time:** Node JS 18.16.0 LTS
* **IDE:** Microsoft Visual Studio Code

### Installation & Running Instructions

First step is to “Fork” the project under your name and keep the `main` branch always sync’d with this repository to ensure there are no issues with your Pull Request like those dreaded Merge Conflicts! 😈

1. Clone the Repository (your fork) and make sure it’s in the latest `main` branch.
2. If you think it might be stale, issue a `git pull` so that it’s up to date.
3. If you’re running for the first time, install the dependencies by running `npm ci` (or if you’re not lazy, run `npm clean-install`).
4. Once the installation is over, start the app locally by running `npm start`.
5. Hope everything works, check by opening http://localhost:3000/ on your browser (it might have already started your browser, kindly check).

Here are all the commands...

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/<Your-GitHub-Username>/GitHub-ReadMe.git
$ npm ci
$ npm start
```

If `npm ci` gives issues on Windows or Linux machines, please use `npm i` (or if you’re not lazy, run `npm install`).

If you’re facing any issues, feel free to message me on WhatsApp / LinkedIn / Twitter / Discord / Email (on the order of responsivenes, email being the slowest)! 😅
